9,Berkshire Jalapenito IPA,Berkshire Brewing Company,Beer,"What is IPA?

IPAs, short for India Pale Ale is a beer characterized by its hoppy character and popularity in the craft beer scene. It was actually invented as a solution to provide beer for the British Empire in the east. To get beer from London to India without spoiling, a brewer named Hodgson invented a heavily hopped beer to survive the journey. Not only did it survive, it actually improved in flavor over time. Thus, the beginnings of the IPAs that are known and loved today were born. Today, IPAs come in a number of styles including British, West Coast, New England, and East Coast, to name a few. Each of these styles has different hop varieties and flavor profiles, fit for any palate.",Massachusetts,"Spicy Mexican dishes, Grilled chicken, Pepper jack cheese",7.2-10.0° C
10,Berkshire Brewing Co. Black IPA,Berkshire Brewing Company,Beer,"The first vintage in our Brewer's Choice Series IPA is a Black IPA, showing off with an impressive 70 IBU's.

The backbone for this India style black ale is an aggressive addition of American-grown ""superalpha"" bittering hops. Later hop additions in the boil, give this beer its unique aromatic properties. Seven days of conditioning on an absurd amount of dry hops add to the powerful floral and citrus performance that dances back and forth for your senses to enjoy, until the very last drop makes its way from your glass.","South Deerfield, Massachusetts","Spicy BBQ ribs, Sharp cheddar cheese, Dark chocolate.",7.2-10.0° C

15,Berkshire Brewing Company Easy Like Mosaic NEIPA,Berkshire Brewing Company,Beer,"What is New England / Hazy IPA?

New England / Hazy IPA is a style of beer that has become increasingly popular in recent years. The New England / Hazy IPA (India Pale Ale, for the long version) is characterized by a hazy, slightly opaque appearance and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. There's a number of beers in this category that are lovingly called juice bombs, because they flavor feels like the perfect combination of orange juice and beer. Thank us later. The flavor is a complex balance of hop bitterness and hop aromas of tropical and citrus fruits, with a hint of malt sweetness. The malt in this beer variety provides a light body and smooth finish that is complemented by light bitterness that doesn't overly linger. You'll find that many, if not most NEIPAs have a higher ABV than other IPA varietals, usually between 5.5% - 7.5% ABV.","South Deerfield, Massachusetts","Spicy Thai curry, Grilled chicken, Citrus salad",7.2-10.0° C
